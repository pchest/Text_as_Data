## 1 Setting up Quanteda 

# Clear Global Environment
rm(list = ls())

# Set working directory

# Installs the package "devtools" which is used to install packages directly from Github
install.packages("devtools")

# Installs the latest version of Kenneth Benoit's quanteda
devtools::install_github("kbenoit/quanteda")

# and quantedaData
devtools::install_github("kbenoit/quantedaData")

# Loading both packages into our environment
library(quanteda)
library(quantedaData)


## 2 Running basic text analysis

# start with a short character vector
sampletxt <- "The police with their policing strategy instituted a policy of general 
iterations at the Data Science Institute."

# Let's tokenize (break vector into individual words)
tokens <- tokenize(sampletxt)
?tokenize

tokens <- tokenize(sampletxt, removePunct=TRUE)

# Stemming examples

stems <- tokens_wordstem(tokens)
?tokens_wordstem

# Loading State of the Union corpus

data("SOTUCorpus", package = "quantedaData")

# ndoc identifies the number of documents in a corpus

ndocs <- ndoc(SOTUCorpus)

# Here, we identifiy the text of the last SOTU Speech in the corpus

last_speech_text <- SOTUCorpus[ndocs]

# same as 

last_speech_text <- texts(SOTUCorpus)[ndocs]

# The DFM function creates a Document Feature Matrix from the last SOTU speech

obama_dfm <- dfm(last_speech_text)
?dfm

# Inspecting the components of a DFM object

str(obama_dfm)

obama_dfm[1,1:20]

# The topfeatures function by default shows the most frequently occuring terms in a given DFM

topfeatures(obama_dfm)

# Are all of these features relevant?

# Stopwords

# Stopwords are commonly used words that add little understanding to the content of the document by themselves

# The stopwords function takes a language as an input and produces a vector of stopwords compiled from that language

stopwords("english")

# Fun fact: Quanteda also supports stopwords for english, SMART, danish, french, greek, hungarian, 
# norwegian, russian, swedish, catalan, dutch, finnish, german, italian, portuguese, spanish, and arabic

# Here we compare a DFM from the last SOTU while without English stopwords with one that has them

obama_dfm1 <- dfm(last_speech_text, removePunct = TRUE)
obama_dfm2 <- dfm(last_speech_text, remove = stopwords("english"), removePunct = TRUE)

topfeatures(obama_dfm1)
topfeatures(obama_dfm2)

## 3 Visualization and Weighted DFM

# Now we will create a DFM of all the SOTU speeches

full_dfm <- dfm(SOTUCorpus, remove = stopwords("english"), removePunct = TRUE)

topfeatures(full_dfm)

# Visualizing the text contained within the data frame

textplot_wordcloud(full_dfm)

# tfidf - Frequency weighting

weighted_dfm <- tfidf(full_dfm) # Uses the absolute frequency of terms in each document

topfeatures(weighted_dfm)
?tfidf

# tfidf - Relative frequency weighting

normalized <- tfidf(full_dfm, normalize=TRUE) # Uses the relative number of terms in each document

topfeatures(normalized)

# What do the different rankings imply?


## 4 Collocations

# bigrams

collocations(last_speech_text)
?collocations

# trigrams

collocations(last_speech_text, size=3)

# detect collocations in overall

colloc <- collocations(last_speech_text)


# remove any collocations containing a word in the stoplist

removeFeatures(colloc, stopwords("english"))

# Are there any other terms you all think are interesting?


## 5 Regular expressions

# regular expressions are a very powerful tool in wrangling text
# not a focus of this class, but something to be aware of

?regex

s_index <- grep(" s ", texts(SOTUCorpus))

?grep

# this returns every speech that contains " s "
s_texts <- grep(" s ", texts(SOTUCorpus), value=TRUE)

# Here we create a vector of documents with " s " removed
no_s <- gsub(" s ", "",  SOTUCorpus[s_index])
